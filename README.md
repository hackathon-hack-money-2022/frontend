# Rebalancer - Frontend
[Rebalancer is an application taking inspiration from the now shutdown Prism exchange.](https://github.com/hackathon-hack-money-2022/.github/blob/main/profile/README.md)

In this repository is the basic frontend for allowing users to create a "simple" portfolio using the Rebalance [contracts](https://github.com/hackathon-hack-money-2022/contracts) created for [https://hackathon.money/](https://hackathon.money/).

### Future work
- Add option to withdraw capital 
- Use real data and not mock data i.e integrate with a backend that stores metadata to something like FileCoin / web3 storage
- Create sine "social" features i.e follow a "portfolio"
